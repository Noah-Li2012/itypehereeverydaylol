i am currently thinking about what video to make, and why should i make vidoes? for views? not coming, for subcribes? for likes? no it never comes without views, what the point then? for fun? for learning? for whatever i am doing rn, i make videos to make videos,saving there as a history of my projects, not for views,but for myself to watch, it's not like views decides u should make videos or not, it's like u decides u should make videos to get views or not
