idk why i forgot to post yesterday or do i even remember did i post yesterday cuz of my not-busy studying and what video to post this week or even how do i make the thing i want to make, it's pretty messy, and i still want to know how do i get more views cuz my avg views ae 4, but yeah,everyone start from this right? No cuz those shorts with edits of others' video gain views fast,cuz they copy good ones, easy? NO, cuz they have good GPU and have the power to record,not like me stucking at 20 FPS in OBS studio damn it
