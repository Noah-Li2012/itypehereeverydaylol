whenever you're bored, you might ask AIs to give you `riddles`, but- ofc, today i'm bored and ask chatgpt for a riddle,ykw? same riddle every chat,like looping-i guess if it just only knows those? maybe i'll try other AIs? yeah so i tried gimini,claude, wtf why the f it has the same riddle too?! so i get bored again,maybe i'll search riddles on google- okay it's also the same. I search for riddles on tons of AI and search engines, it's kinda always the same right? wait, i'm not bored when i try to search more riddles?
